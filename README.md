# Simon-Game
Built a Simon-Game without using any Raw HTML, CSS and JavaScript without using any external libraries.

The Game The rules of the game are as follows:

1.Watch and remember a sequence of colors/sounds shown by the game.

2.Repeat the sequence by pressing the buttons in the same order.

3.The game gets harder as the sequences get longer.

4.If you make a mistake, the game ends.

5.Try to achieve the highest score by correctly repeating longer sequences.

6.You can restart the game to beat your previous score.

High Score Table:

In order to add a bit healthy competition to the game, a high score table system is implemented.
When the game is over (due to choose wrong color) and then your high score table should then be shown to the user.
